The spectral solar irradiance (foc) provided in the file is the top of the atmosphere solar flux 
(fo) convolved with the relative response function (RSR) of the IIRS instrument for band nos. 
6 to 255 (band nos. 1-5 and 256 are low response bands not useful for scientific analysis). 
The fo values are taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate 
Data Record (NOAA CDR).  The fo is the average of the values from 2010 to 2019.

The foc values can be directly used for the conversion of IIRS spectral radiance (I) to the 
spectral reflectance (R) values by using the following formula:

R = π*d2*I/ (μo* foc)

where, d is the solar distance in astronomical units (AU) and μo is the cosine of the incidence angle.
